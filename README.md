SNHU CS 320 Software Testing

Testing is the only way to ensure that software is both functional and secure. Unit tests, along with dependency testing (where applicable), ensures that code is high-quality, meeting specific user needs and functions as expected.
Communicating with clients and gathering requirements is the first step in any development process. Ensuring you understand client requirements clearly is a very important step, as it guides the rest of the project. Client needs should be transformed into use cases, and those can be transformed into JUnit tests. 
Designing software begins with an idea, sure, but it also has to meet certain needs and requirements. Without use cases, a project or software is useless. If a piece of code functions, but doesn't meet any user needs, no one will use it. We, as developers, need to recognize these needs and meet them with our design. Gathering requirements, expectations, and meeting these needs with functional, realistic software is the key to success in software development.
